This repo consists of all the OTs as python code... OT is a 3rd sem course that is offered for CSE in amrita

## 🤷‍♂️What it is ....
This is a CL tool that is helpful for solving problems from the course of optimisation techniques offered in amrita. This is not so efficient code (I am a noob) 😓but does the job a lot easier and accurate than pen and paper.... 

The whole code is written in python language and it doesn't require any of the libraries to be install again. Give it a try and see how it works.....

run it using: 

    python3 script.py
