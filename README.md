This repo consists of all the OTs as python code... OT is a 3rd sem course that is offered for CSE in amrita

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWhat it is ....
This is a CL tool that is helpful for solving problems from the course of optimisation techniques offered in amrita.  I wrote it for myself during COVID-19 time and it was there with me since then. This tool will not give you complete step by step solution but will give you all the important values. I didn't the code for detailed explanation (I am a noob) üòìbut does the job a lot easier and accurate than pen and paper.... 

The whole code is written in python language and it doesn't require any of the libraries to be install again. Give it a try and see how it works.....

run it using: 

    python3 script.py
